        <p>This class is designed for women or for anyone wanting to learn feminine styling in Latin dance. Each
          season we choose a different style of Latin dance for our choreography. Our ladies class focuses on
          feminine
          movement and styling through core movement, footwork, and upper body movement. All levels are welcome,
          however we do recommend those who join to have a solid understanding of salsa basic footwork patter. We
          also
          recommend those who plan on performing to attend our drop-in technique classes. Call to register for this
          class or to see when our next choreography begins.</p>
