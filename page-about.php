          <h2>Gustavo Nicola</h2>
          <p>
            Gustavo's passion is in Latin Dance. He started his dance
            education with a group called Grupo del Sur. Gustavo's
            dedication to the art form had him dancing in a professional
            dance group after only 2 years. During his time dancing in
            Argentina, Gustavo performed for numerous nationally recognized
            artists. It wasn't long before Gustavo decided to open his own
            dance studio in Argentina. His studio was an immediate success
            and the talk of the town for 2 years. Gustavo was then presented
            with the opportunity to travel to Las Vegas and compete in the
            World Salsa Championship which aired on ESPN. Gustavo wanted to
            continue his experience in dance around the world and traveled
            to Mexico where he was offered work as a professional dancer and
            choreographer for 7 years. In 2014 Gustavo opened the doors to
            Milwaukee’s premier Latin dance studio, Gustavo Krystal Dance.

          <h2>Krystal Nicola</h2>
          <p>
            Krystal´s desire to dance started at the young age of two.
            Growing up as a young dancer in the United states she studied
            tap, ballet, jazz, modern, hip hop, afro and ballroom. She
            competed in countless competitions and studied from well-known
            choreographers such as Mia Michaels and Dee Caspery. In college
            she studied musical theater to improving her understanding of
            music and theatre as a whole. In 2006 she moved to Mexico where
            she began her professional career as a dancer and choreographer.
            She spent most of her time in Mexico working for the
            internationally recognized company Nuevo Milenio Balet where she
            furthered her education in Latin dance. Her countless hours on
            stage helped Krystal polish her stage presence and better her
            technique. In January 2013, Krystal moved to the United States
            to pursue her lifetime dream of owning and running her own dance
            studio. With over 30 years of dance experience, Krystal enjoys
            sharing her experiences and techniques with her students.

          <h2>Debrasha Greye</h2>
          <p>
            Debrasha’s love for the performing arts was cultivated throughout her involvement in Milwaukee area Dance
            and Theatre Arts programs including Art In Motion, City Ballet Theatre, Modjeska Youth Theatre, Lincoln
            Center of the Arts, Milwaukee High School of the Arts and Brown Deer High School. Seeking to continue her
            growth as a performer, Debrasha participated in the Intensive Study Program with Danceworks, Inc. in 2012.
            This opportunity led to performance and teaching experiences with Mad Hot Ballroom and Tap, the United
            Performing Arts Fund (UPAF), public and private school residencies, and various local performance venues.
            Dedicated to expanding her artistic repertoire, Debrasha has studied dance in studios from Latin America to
            Germany. Her abundance of dance experiences and commitment to the arts led her to further express her
            talents through arts administration. Debrasha joined choreography teams with Gustavo Krystal Dance Studio in
            March 2019 and is thrilled by the plethora of performance and teaching opportunities that continue to arise.
