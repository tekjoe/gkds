            Because of a high demand we offer 3 levels of salsa choreography. Level placement is determined by our
            staff. Choreography groups begin periodically throughout the year and require prior registration. All of our
            groups require a basic knowledge of our Salsa level A curriculum. These groups allow our students to expand
            their knowledge of salsa movement as well as providing performance opportunities and well as competition
            opportunities in the higher levels. All groups meet twice weekly. Call to register today!

            This class is designed for women or for anyone wanting to learn feminine styling in Latin dance. Each season
            we choose a different style of Latin dance for our choreography. Our ladies class focuses on feminine
            movement and styling through core movement, footwork, and upper body movement. All levels are welcome,
            however we do recommend those who join to have a solid understanding of salsa basic footwork patter. We also
            recommend those who plan on performing to attend our drop-in technique classes. Call to register for this
            class or to see when our next choreography begins.
